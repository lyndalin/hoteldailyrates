# Predicting average daily rates at a hotel
 
Using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) to build various models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest, spline regression) to predict average daily rates at a resort hotel. The data were obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand#hotel_bookings.csv). The dataset was modified from its original source to include 18 of the original 32 variables.
